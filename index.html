  					<h4>About Me</h4>
  					<p>I'm a senior Computer Science major at OSU searching for a full time job starting Summer 2017. I have experience with Java, Python, Swift, and C and also a little Ruby and javascript. You can read about some of my projects below. Recently I've been working with APIs and iOS applications. I spent last Summer interning at American Greetings as a python web developer. I'm currently working as a C-Store manager and administrative assistant for campus dining services where I am primarily responsible for placing and receiving food orders and managing support tickets from dining locations. These include help with technical issues such as new users and cash register changes.</p>

  							<p class='text-left'>Created for my information security class, Drones on ice is an imaginary company delivering ice cream by drone. The iOS app lets users create an account, pick a flavor, pay with apple pay, then monitor their order progress. The associated web service, written in python with flask, keeps track of the orders and allows them to be viewed and fulfilled using an "employee website".</p>

  							<p class='text-left'>American Greetings held a 24 hour hack day for the interns. I started at 9:00 am and worked through the night till 9:00 am the next morning. I made an app for iOS that can be used to customize a card in a unique way then have it printed and mailed. The next morning I presented to a the rest of the department and placed second out of eight individuals/teams.</p>

  							<a href='bellfinder.jpg'><img class='project' src='bellfinder.jpg''></a><p></p>
  							<p class='text-left'>One of the biggest issues faced by prospective homebuyers (in my opinon) is finding a home near a Taco Bell. Luckily there's Bell Finder, available in the chrome store, which displays the time and distance to the nearest taco bell on Zillow listings. Someone tweeted the extension to Taco Bell and they responded "We salute you Adam"</p>

  							<p class='text-left'>In January 2016, University Dining Services launched online ordering for three dining locations. I asked my boss if there was any plan for a mobile application that would make ordering easier. He said no. The experience on mobile devices in the browser was subpar and adoption has been slow so I made an app that made it easy to order on an iPhone. The app was available in the App Store until the end of the semester when Dining Services contracted with an outside vendor to run a new mobile order and delivery service.</p>

  						<div class="panel-body">
  							<p class='text-left'>As part of my Web Apps class I worked in a group of 5 to make a ruby on rails website. My group created a webside called Studdy Buddies where OSU students could put in their class schedule and rate the importance of each class then be shown people who have matching schedules and preferences who they might want to study with.</p>

  							<a href='set.png'><img class='project' src='set.png''></a><p></p>
  							<p class='text-left'>Set is a card matching game. A "set" is 3 cards who for each of 4 properties (color, number, shape, and shading) are either all the same or all different. As part of my web applications class, my group was tasked with programming a version of the game in Ruby. The project had few requirements and was mostly open ended. My group and I decided to implement many optional features including a graphical interface, hints, multiplayer, scoring, and a timer. I'm very happy with the finished product. My group worked very well together and the game ended up being pretty cool in my opinon.</p>

  							<a href='price.png'><img class='project' src='price.png''></a><p></p>
  							<p class='text-left'>The primary grocery vendor at the convenience store where I work updates their pricing every 2 weeks. These changes weren't always well communicated which left us with inconsistant margins, incorrect price tags, and items ringing up for the wrong amount. I wrote a C program to compare pricing from the vendor's SQLite database against our cash register's CSV item list and display inconsistencies. The program brought the pricing issue to the attention of the directors of dining who ultimately decided pricing should freeze during each semester.</p>

  							<a href='inventory.png'><img class='project' src='inventory.png''></a><p></p>
  							<p class='text-left'>Inventory is taken every Sunday in the convenience store where I work. It used to be that we would print an 18 page list of our 500 items from a spreadsheet then write in the counts of each product and type them back into the computer. This wasted a lot of time. I wrote a Java program that used a USB barcode scanner to make the process simpler. The user scans the item or its tag and types the number on the laptop. The program outputs a spreadsheet with all the data. I used the program every week for 2 years until dining services purchased inventory guns.</p>
