  					<h4>About Me</h4>
  					<p>I'm a senior Computer Science major at OSU searching for a full time job starting Summer 2017. I have experience with Java, Python, Swift, and C and also a little Ruby and javascript. You can read about some of my projects below. Recently I've been working with APIs and iOS applications. I spent last Summer interning at American Greetings as a python web developer. I'm currently working as a C-Store manager and administrative assistant for campus dining services where I am primarily responsible for placing and receiving food orders and managing support tickets from dining locations. These include help with technical issues such as new users and cash register changes.</p>
